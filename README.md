# Get5-Web API Plugin
Plugin For My Forked Get5-Web Panel.

This plugin is to be used in conjuction with [get5-web](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/get5-web) that I have pulled and made various modifications to. It includes various changes, such as tracking vetoes to a database, and uploading the demo of a match once the match is completed.

# Requirements
In order to compile this and use it on a server, you must have:

- [SteamWorks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KyleSanderson/SteamWorks/master/Pawn/includes/SteamWorks.inc)
- [sm-json](https://github.com/clugg/sm-json)
- [System2](https://github.com/dordnung/System2/releases)

Once these requirements are met, you may build the plugin with `spcomp`. If you do not wish to build from source, the latest version of the plugin is both available in the releases both on [get5-web](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/get5-web/releases/download/0.6/get5_apistats.smx) and [get5-webapi](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/get5-webapi/releases/download/1.0/get5_apistats.smx).

# Thanks To
